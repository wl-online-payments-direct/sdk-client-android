# Online Payments - Android SDK

The Online Payments Android SDK helps you accept payments in your Android app, supporting API level 21 and up, through
the Online Payments platform.

The SDK's primary function is establishing a secure channel between your Android app and our server. This channel
processes security credentials to guarantee the safe transit of your customers' data during the payment process.

**The Online Payments SDK helps you with:**

- Handling encryption of the payment context
- Convenient Java wrappers for API responses
- User-friendly formatting of payment data, such as card numbers and expiry dates
- Validating user input
- Determining the card's associated payment provider

## Installation

Add a dependency to the SDK in your app's `build.gradle` file, where `x.y.z` is the version number:

    dependencies {
        // other dependencies
        implementation 'com.worldline-solutions:sdk-client-android:x.y.z'
    }

## Example apps

For your convenience, the SDK comes with an example app in both Kotlin and Java that you can use as
a basis for your own implementation. The Kotlin example app offers a Jetpack Compose implementation
as well as a traditional XML based implementation, whereas the Java example app offers only a
traditional XML implementation. If you are fine with the look-and-feel of the example app, you do
not need to make any changes at all. Take a look at
the [Kotlin](https://github.com/wl-online-payments-direct/sdk-client-android-example-kotlin)
or [Java](https://github.com/wl-online-payments-direct/sdk-client-android-example) example apps.

## Quick overview

To accept your first payment using the SDK, complete the steps below. Also see the
section [Payment Steps](#payment-steps) for more details on these steps.

1. Request your server to create a Client Session, using one of our available Server SDKs. Return the session details to
   your app.

2. Initialize the SDK using the session details. Note that the first four arguments come from the Server SDK Create
   Session call one in the previous step.

   **_java:_**
   ```java
   Session session = new Session(
       "47e9dc332ca24273818be2a46072e006", // client session id
       "9991-0d93d6a0e18443bd871c89ec6d38a873", // customer id
       "https://clientapi.com", // client API URL
       "https://assets.com", // asset URL
       false, // states if the environment is production, this property is used to determine the Google Pay environment
       "Android Example Application/v2.0.4", // your application identifier
       true, // if true, requests and responses will be logged to the console; not supplying this parameter means it is false; should be false in production
       getApplicationContext() // this will get your Java application context
   );
   ```

   **_kotlin:_**
   ```kotlin
   val session = Session(
       "47e9dc332ca24273818be2a46072e006", // client session id
       "9991-0d93d6a0e18443bd871c89ec6d38a873", // customer id
       "https://clientapi.com", // client API URL
       "https://assets.com", // asset URL
       false, // states if the environment is production, this property is used to determine the Google Pay environment
       "Android Example Application/v2.0.4", // your application identifier
       true, // if true, requests and responses will be logged to the console; not supplying this parameter means it is false; should be false in production
       getApplication<Application>().applicationContext
   )
   ```

3. Configure your payment context.

   **_java:_**
   ```java
   AmountOfMoney amountOfMoney = new AmountOfMoney(
       1298L, // in cents as a Long
       "EUR" // three letter currency code as defined in ISO 4217
   );
    
   PaymentContext paymentContext = new PaymentContext(
       amountOfMoney,
       "NL", // two letter country code as defined in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
       false // true, if it is a recurring payment
   );
   ```

   **_kotlin:_**
   ```kotlin
   val amountOfMoney = AmountOfMoney(
       1298L, // in cents as a Long
       "EUR" // three letter currency code as defined in ISO 4217
   )
    
   val paymentContext = PaymentContext(
       amountOfMoney,
       "NL", // two letter country code as defined in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
       false // true, if it is a recurring payment
   )
   ```

4. Retrieve the available Payment Products. After successfully retrieving the Payment Products,
   display the `BasicPaymentItem` and `AccountOnFile` lists and request your customer to select one.\
   **Note:** each session call can throw errors. Wrap your code into the try/catch block.\
   **Note 2:** Since Kotlin methods are asynchronous (using coroutines), there are synchronous overloads with `Sync`
   suffixes.

   **_java:_**
   ```java
   // sync call
   try {
       BasicPaymentItems basicPaymentItems = session.getBasicPaymentItemsSync(paymentContext);

       // Display the contents of basicPaymentItems & accountsOnFile to your customer.
   } catch (e: ApiException) {
       // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
   } catch (e: CommunicationException) {
       // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
   } catch (e: Exception) {
       // Handle any other unhandled exception.
   }

   // async call
   session.getBasicPaymentItems(paymentContext, new Continuation<BasicPaymentItems>() {
       @Override
       public CoroutineContext getContext() {
           return EmptyCoroutineContext.INSTANCE;
       }
   
       @Override
       public void resumeWith(Object result) {
           if (result instanceof Result.Failure) {
               Throwable exception = ((Result.Failure) result).getException();
               // Check for specific exception types
               if (exception instanceof ApiException) {
                   // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
               } else if (exception instanceof CommunicationException) {
                   // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
               } else {
                   // Handle any other unhandled exceptions.
               }
           } else {
               // Successful result. Continue with the code execution.
               BasicPaymentProducts products = (BasicPaymentProducts) result;
               // Display the contents of basicPaymentItems & accountsOnFile to your customer.
           }
       }
   });
   ```

   **_kotlin:_**
   ```kotlin
   try {
       val basicPaymentItems = session.getBasicPaymentItems(paymentContext)
    
       // Display the contents of basicPaymentItems & accountsOnFile to your customer.
   } catch (e: ApiException) {
       // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
   } catch (e: CommunicationException) {
       // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
   } catch (e: Exception) {
       // Handle any other unhandled exception.
   }
   ```

5. Once the customer has selected the desired payment product, retrieve the enriched`PaymentProduct`
   detailing what information the customer needs to provide to authorize the payment. After successfully retrieving
   the `PaymentProduct`, display the required information fields to your customer.

   **_java:_**
   ```java
   // sync call
   try {
       PaymentProduct paymentProduct = session.getPaymentProductSync(paymentProductId, paymentContext);

       // Display the fields to your customer.
   } catch (e: ApiException) {
       // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
   } catch (e: CommunicationException) {
       // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
   } catch (e: Exception) {
       // Handle any other unhandled exception.
   }
   ```

   **_kotlin:_**
   ```kotlin
   try {
       val paymentProduct = session.getPaymentProduct(paymentProductId, paymentContext)

       // Display the fields to your customer.
   } catch (e: ApiException) {
       // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
   } catch (e: CommunicationException) {
       // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
   } catch (e: Exception) {
       // Handle any other unhandled exception.
   }
   ```

6. Save the customer's input for the required information fields in a `PaymentRequest`.

   **_java:_**
   ```java
   PaymentRequest paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest();
    
   paymentRequest.setValue(
       "cardNumber", // field id
       "12451254457545" // unmasked value
   );
   paymentRequest.setValue("cvv","123");
   paymentRequest.setValue("expiryDate","1225");
   ```

   **_kotlin:_**
   ```kotlin
   var paymentRequest = PaymentRequest()
    
   paymentRequest.setValue(
       "cardNumber", // field id
       "12451254457545" // unmasked value
   )
   paymentRequest.setValue("cvv","123")
   paymentRequest.setValue("expiryDate","1225")
   ```

7. Validate and encrypt the payment request. After successfully encrypting the `PaymentRequest`, you will have access
   to the encrypted version, `PreparedPaymentRequest`. The encrypted customer data should then be sent to your server.

   **_java:_**
   ```java
   try {
       PreparedPaymentRequest preparedRequest = session.preparePaymentRequestSync(paymentRequest);

       // Send the preparedRequest.encryptedFields to your server and use it to create the payment with the Server SDK.
   } catch (e: EncryptDataException) {
       // Handle the ecryption exception.
   } catch (e: Exception) {
       // Handle any other unhandled exception.
   }
   ```

   **_kotlin:_**
   ```kotlin
   try {
       val preparedRequest = session.preparePaymentRequest(paymentRequest)

       // Send the preparedRequest.encryptedFields to your server and use it to create the payment with the Server SDK.
   } catch (e: EncryptDataException) {
       // Handle the ecryption exception.
   } catch (e: Exception) {
       // Handle any other unhandled exception.
   }
   ```

8. Request your server to create a payment request using the Server APIs Create Payment call.
   Provide the encrypted data in the `encryptedCustomerInput` field.
   Check
   the [API documentation](https://docs.direct.worldline-solutions.com/en/api-reference#tag/Payments/operation/CreatePaymentApi)
   for more details.

## Type definitions

### Session

An instance of the `Session` class is required for all interactions with the SDK. The following code fragment shows how
`Session` is initialized. The session details are obtained by performing a Create Client Session call using the Server
API (not part of this SDK).

**_java:_**

```java
Session session = new Session(
    "47e9dc332ca24273818be2a46072e006", // client session id
    "9991-0d93d6a0e18443bd871c89ec6d38a873", // customer id
    "https://clientapi.com", // client API URL
    "https://assets.com", // asset URL
    false, // states if the environment is production, this property is used to determine the Google Pay environment
    "Android Example Application/v2.0.4", // your application identifier
    true, // if true, requests and responses will be logged to the console; not supplying this parameter means it is false; should be false in production
    getApplicationContext() // this will get your Java application context
);
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
val session = Session(
    "47e9dc332ca24273818be2a46072e006", // client session id
    "9991-0d93d6a0e18443bd871c89ec6d38a873", // customer id
    "https://clientapi.com", // client API URL
    "https://assets.com", // asset URL
    false, // states if the environment is production, this property is used to determine the Google Pay environment
    "Android Example Application/v2.0.4", // your application identifier
    true, // if true, requests and responses will be logged to the console; not supplying this parameter means it is false; should be false in production
    getApplication<Application>().applicationContext
)
```

Almost all methods that are offered by `Session` are simple wrappers around the Client API. They create the request and
convert the response to Java objects that may contain convenience functions.

#### Logging of requests and responses

You can log requests made to the server and responses received from the server. By default, logging is disabled,
and it is essential to disable it in production. You can enable logging in two ways. Either by setting its value
when creating a Session - as shown in the code fragment above - or by setting its value after the Session was already
created.

**_java:_**

```java
session.setLoggingEnabled(true);
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
session.setLoggingEnabled(true)
```

### PaymentContext

`PaymentContext` is an object that contains the context/settings of the upcoming payment. It is required as an argument
to some of the methods of the `Session` instance. This object can contain the following details:

**_java:_**

```java
public class PaymentContext {
    private AmountOfMoney amountOfMoney; // contains the total amount and the ISO 4217 currency code
    private String countryCode; // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code
    private boolean isRecurring; // Set `true` when payment is recurring. Default false.
}
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
data class PaymentContext(
    var amountOfMoney: AmountOfMoney? = null, // contains the total amount and the ISO 4217 currency code
    var countryCode: String? = null, // ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code
    var isRecurring: Boolean = false // Set `true` when payment is recurring. Default false.
) : Serializable { ... }
```

### PaymentItems

This object contains the available Payment Items for the current payment. Use the
`session.getBasicPaymentItems` function to request the data.

The object you will receive is `BasicPaymentItems`, which contains two lists. One for all available
`BasicPaymentItem`s and one for all available `AccountOnFile`s.

The code fragment below shows how to get the `BasicPaymentItems` instance.

**_java:_**

```java
// sync call
try {
   BasicPaymentItems basicPaymentItems = session.getBasicPaymentItemsSync(paymentContext);

   // Display the contents of basicPaymentItems & accountsOnFile to your customer.
} catch (e: ApiException) {
   // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
} catch (e: CommunicationException) {
   // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
} catch (e: Exception) {
   // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
try {
   val basicPaymentItems = session.getBasicPaymentItems(paymentContext)

   // Display the contents of basicPaymentItems & accountsOnFile to your customer.
} catch (e: ApiException) {
   // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
} catch (e: CommunicationException) {
   // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
} catch (e: Exception) {
   // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

### BasicPaymentProduct

The SDK offers two types to represent information about payment products: `BasicPaymentProduct` and `PaymentProduct`.
Practically speaking, instances of `BasicPaymentProduct` contain only the information that is required to display a
simple list of payment products from which the customer can select one.

The type `PaymentProduct` contains additional information, such as the specific form fields definitions that the
customer is required to fill out. This type is typically used when creating a form that asks the customer for their
details. See the [PaymentProduct](#paymentproduct) section for more info.

Below is an example for how to obtain display names and assets for the Visa product.

**_java:_**

```java
BasicPaymentItem basicPaymentProduct = paymentItems.getBasicPaymentItemById("1");

String id = basicPaymentProduct.getId();
String label = basicPaymentProduct.getDisplayHintsList().get(0).getLabel();
String logoUrl = basicPaymentProduct.getDisplayHintsList().get(0).getLogoUrl();
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
val basicPaymentProduct = paymentItems.getBasicPaymentItemById("1")

val id = basicPaymentProduct.id
val label = basicPaymentProduct.displayHintsList[0].label
val logoUrl = basicPaymentProduct.displayHintsList[0].logoUrl
```

### AccountOnFile

An instance of `AccountOnFile` represents information about a stored card product for the current customer.
`AccountOnFile` IDs available for the current payment must be provided in the request body of the Server API Create
Client Session call. If the customer wishes to use an existing `AccountOnFile` for a payment, the selected
`AccountOnFile` should be added to the `PaymentRequest`. The code fragment below shows how display data for an account
on file can be retrieved. This label can be shown to the customer, along with the logo of the corresponding payment
product.

**_java:_**

```java
// All available accounts on file for the payment product
List<AccountOnFile> allAccountsOnFile = basicPaymentProduct.getAccountsOnFile();

// Get specific account on file for the payment product
AccountOnFile accountOnFile = null;

for (AccountOnFile aof : basicPaymentProduct.getAccountsOnFile()) {
    if (Objects.equals(aof.getId(), identifier)) { // 'identifier' is the ID of the AccountOnFile selected by the customer
        accountOnFile = aof;
        break;
    }
}

// Shows a mask based formatted value for the obfuscated cardNumber.
// The mask that is used is defined in the displayHints of this accountOnFile
// If the mask for the "cardNumber" field is {{9999}} {{9999}} {{9999}} {{9999}}, then the result would be **** **** **** 7412
String maskedValue = accountOnFile.getMaskedValue("cardNumber");
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
// All available accounts on file for the payment product
val allAccountsOnFile = basicPaymentProduct.accountsOnFile

// Get specific account on file for the payment product
val accountOnFile = basicPaymentProduct.accountsOnFile
    .firstOrNull { it.id == identifier } // 'identifier' is the ID of the AccountOnFile selected by the customer

// Shows a mask-based formatted value for the obfuscated card number
// The mask that is used is defined in the displayHints of this accountOnFile
// If the mask for the "cardNumber" field is {{9999}} {{9999}} {{9999}} {{9999}}, then the result would be **** **** **** 7412
val maskedValue = accountOnFile?.getMaskedValue("cardNumber") ?: ""
```

### PaymentProduct

`BasicPaymentProduct` only contains the information required by a customer to distinguish one payment product from
another. However, once a payment product has been selected, the customer must provide additional information, such as
a bank account number, a credit card number, or an expiry date, before a payment can be processed. Each payment product
can have several fields that need to be completed to process a payment. Instances of `BasicPaymentProduct` do not
contain any information about these fields.

Information about the fields of payment products are represented by instances of`PaymentProductField`, which are
contained in instances of `PaymentProduct`. The class `PaymentProductField` is described further down below.

The `Session` instance can be used to retrieve the instance of a `PaymentProduct`, as shown in the following code
fragment.

**_java:_**

```java
// Note that exception handling is omitted here. Check the code above for more info. 
PaymentProduct paymentProduct = session.getPaymentProductSync(
    "1", // id of the payment product you want to retrieve
    paymentContext, // PaymentContext
);
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
// Note that exception handling is omitted here. Check the code above for more info. 
val paymentProduct = session.getPaymentProduct(
    "1", // id of the payment product you want to retrieve
    paymentContext, // PaymentContext
)
```

### PaymentProductField

The fields of payment products are represented by instances of `PaymentProductField`. Each field has an identifier, a
type, a definition of restrictions that apply to the value of the field, and information about how the field should be
presented graphically to the customer. Additionally, an instance of a field can be used to determine whether a given
value is valid for the field.

In the code fragment below, the field with identifier `"cvv"` is retrieved from a payment product. The data restrictions
of the field are inspected to see whether the field is a required field or an optional field. Additionally, the display
hints of the field are inspected to see whether the values a customer provides should be obfuscated in a user interface.

**_java:_**

```java
PaymentProductField ccvField = paymentProduct.getPaymentProductFieldById("cvv");

Boolean isRequired = ccvField.getDataRestrictions()
    .isRequired(); // state if value is required for this field
Boolean shouldObfuscate = ccvField.getDisplayHints()
    .isObfuscate(); // state if field value should be obfuscated
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
val ccvField = paymentProduct.getPaymentProductFieldById("cvv")

val isRequired = ccvField.dataRestrictions.isRequired()
val shouldObfuscate = ccvField.displayHints.isObfuscate()
```

### PaymentRequest

Once a payment product has been selected and an instance of `PaymentProduct` has been retrieved, a payment request can
be constructed. This class must be used as a container for all the values the customer provides.

**_java:_**

```java
PaymentRequest paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest(paymentProduct);
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
var paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(paymentProduct)
```

#### Tokenize payment request

A `PaymentProduct` has a property `tokenize`, which is used to indicate whether a payment request should be stored as an
account on file for later use. The code fragment below shows how a payment request should be constructed when the
request should be stored as an account on file. By default, `tokenize` is set to `false`.

**_java:_**

```java
// you can supply tokenize via the constructor
PaymentRequest paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest(paymentProduct, true);

// Or you can set the request's tokenize property after having initialized the paymentRequest
paymentRequest.setTokenize(true);
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
// you can supply tokenize via the constructor
var paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(paymentProduct, true)

// Or you can set the request's tokenize property after having initialized the paymentRequest
paymentRequest.tokenize = true
```

If the customer selected an account on file, both the account on file and the corresponding payment product must be
supplied while constructing the payment request, as shown in the code fragment below. Instances of `AccountOnFile` can
be retrieved from instances of `BasicPaymentProduct` and `PaymentProduct`.

**_java:_**

```java
PaymentRequest paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest(
    paymentProduct,
    accountOnFile
); // when you do not pass an accountOnFile argument, it will be null
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
val paymentRequest = PaymentRequest(paymentProduct, accountOnFile)
```

#### Set field values to payment request

Once a payment request has been configured, the value for the payment product's fields can be supplied as shown below.
The identifiers of the fields, such as "cardNumber" and "cvv" in the example below, are used to set the values of the
fields using the payment request. In general, you can retrieve all available fields from the `PaymentProduct` instance.

**_java:_**

```java
PaymentRequest paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest();

paymentRequest.setValue(
    "cardNumber", // field id
    "12451254457545" // unmasked value
);
paymentRequest.setValue("cvv", "123");
paymentRequest.setValue("expiryDate", "1225");
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
var paymentRequest = PaymentRequest()

paymentRequest.setValue("cardNumber", "12451254457545")
paymentRequest.setValue("cvv", "123")
paymentRequest.setValue("expiryDate", "1225")
```

#### Validate payment request

Once all values have been supplied, the payment request can be validated. Behind the scenes the validation uses the
`DataRestrictions` class for each of the fields that were added to the`PaymentRequest`. A list of errors is available
after the validation, which indicates any issues that have occurred during validation. If there are no errors, the
payment request can be encrypted and sent to our platform via your server (Server SDK). If there are validation errors,
the customer should be provided with feedback about these errors.

**_java:_**

```java
// validate all fields in the payment request
List<ValidationErrorMessage> errorMessages = paymentRequest.validate();

// check if the payment request is valid
if (errorMessages.isEmpty()) {
    // payment request is valid
} else {
    // payment request has errors
}
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
// validate all fields in the payment request
val errorMessages = paymentRequest.validate()

// check if the payment request is valid
if (errorMessages.isEmpty()) {
    // payment request is valid
} else {
    // payment request has errors
}
```

The validations are the `Validator`s linked to the `PaymentProductField`, and are returned as a
`ValidationErrorMessage`, for example:

**_java:_**

```java
for (ValidationErrorMessage validationResult : errorMessages) {
    // do something with the error, like displaying it to the user
}
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
for (validationResult in errorMessages) {
    // do something with the error, like displaying it to the user
}
```

#### Encrypt payment request

The `PaymentRequest` is ready for encryption once the `PaymentProduct` is set, the `PaymentProductField` values have
been provided and validated, and potentially the selected `AccountOnFile` or `tokenize` properties have been set. After
successfully encrypting the `PaymentRequest`, you will have access to the encrypted version, `PreparedPaymentRequest`
which contains the encrypted payment request fields and encoded client meta info.

**_java:_**

```java
try {
    PreparedPaymentRequest preparedRequest = session.preparePaymentRequestSync(paymentRequest);
    
    // Send the preparedRequest.encryptedFields to your server and use it to create the payment with the Server SDK.
} catch (e: EncryptDataException) {
    // Handle the ecryption exception.
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
try {
    val preparedRequest = session.preparePaymentRequest(paymentRequest)

    // Send the preparedRequest.encryptedFields to your server and use it to create the payment with the Server SDK.
} catch (e: EncryptDataException) {
    // Handle the ecryption exception.
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

> Although it is possible to use your own encryption algorithms to encrypt a payment request, we
> advise you to use the encryption functionality that is offered by the SDK.

### IINDetails

The first six digits of a payment card number are known as the _Issuer Identification Number (IIN)_. As soon as the
first 6 digits of the card number have been captured, you can use the `session.getIinDetails` call to retrieve the
payment product and network that are associated with the provided IIN. Then you can verify the card type and check if
you can accept this card.

An instance of `Session` can be used to check which payment product is associated with an IIN. This is done via the
`session.getIinDetails` function. The result of this check is an instance of `IinDetailsResponse`. This class has a
property status that indicates the result of the check and a property `paymentProductId` that indicates which payment
product is associated with the IIN. The returned `paymentProductId` can be used to provide visual feedback to the
customer by showing the appropriate payment product logo.

The `IinDetailsResponse` has a status property represented through the `IinStatus` enum. The `IinStatus` enum values
are:

- `SUPPORTED` indicates that the IIN is associated with a payment product that is supported by our platform.
- `UNKNOWN` indicates that the IIN is not recognized.
- `NOT_ENOUGH_DIGITS` indicates that fewer than six digits have been provided and that the IIN check cannot be
  performed.
- `EXISTING_BUT_NOT_ALLOWED` indicates that the provided IIN is recognized, but that the corresponding product is not
  allowed for the current payment.

**_java:_**

```java
// The exception hanlding is omitted from this example. See the examples above.
session.getIinDetailsSync(
    "123456", // partial credit card number
    paymentContext // PaymentContext
);
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
// The exception hanlding is omitted from this example. See the examples above.
session.getIinDetails("123456", paymentContext)
```

Some cards are dual branded and could be processed as either a local card _(with a local brand)_ or an international
card _(with an international brand)_. In case you are not set to process these local cards, this API call will not
return that card type in its response.

### Masking

To help in formatting field values based on masks, the SDK offers a base set of masking functions in `PaymentRequest`,
`PaymentProductField`, and `AccountOnFile`.

This set of masking functions all make use of the `StringFormatter` class to apply the actual logic, which is also
publicly available in the SDK.

### StringFormatter

To help in formatting field values based on masks, the SDK offers the `StringFormatter` class. It allows you to format
field values and apply and remove masks on a string.

**_java:_**

```java
String mask = "{{9999}} {{9999}} {{9999}} {{9999}}";
String value = "1234567890123456";

// apply masked value
String maskedValue = StringFormatter.applyMask(value, mask); // "1234 5678 9012 3456"

// remove masked value
String unmaskedValue = StringFormatter.reoveMask(value, mask); // "1234567890123456"
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
val  mask = "{{9999}} {{9999}} {{9999}} {{9999}}"
val  value = "1234567890123456"

// apply masked value
val maskedValue = StringFormatter.applyMask(value, mask) // "1234 5678 9012 3456"

// remove masked value
val unmaskedValue = StringFormatter.reoveMask(value, mask) // "1234567890123456"
```

## Payment Steps

Setting up and completing a payment using the Android SDK involves the following steps:

### 1. Initialize the Android SDK for this payment

This is done using information such as session and customer identifiers, connection URLs and payment context information
like currency and total amount.

**_java:_**

```java
Session session = new Session(
    "47e9dc332ca24273818be2a46072e006", // client session id
    "9991-0d93d6a0e18443bd871c89ec6d38a873", // customer id
    "https://clientapi.com", // client API URL
    "https://assets.com", // asset URL
    false, // states if the environment is production, this property is used to determine the Google Pay environment
    "Android Example Application/v2.0.4", // your application identifier
    true, // if true, requests and responses will be logged to the console; not supplying this parameter means it is false; should be false in production
    getApplicationContext() // this will get your Java application context
);

AmountOfMoney amountOfMoney = new AmountOfMoney(
    1298L, // in cents as a Long
    "EUR" // three letter currency code as defined in ISO 4217
);

PaymentContext paymentContext = new PaymentContext(
    amountOfMoney,
    "NL", // two letter country code as defined in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
    false // true, if it is a recurring payment
);
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
val session = Session(
    "47e9dc332ca24273818be2a46072e006", // client session id
    "9991-0d93d6a0e18443bd871c89ec6d38a873", // customer id
    "https://clientapi.com", // client API URL
    "https://assets.com", // asset URL
    false, // states if the environment is production, this property is used to determine the Google Pay environment
    "Android Example Application/v2.0.4", // your application identifier
    true, // if true, requests and responses will be logged to the console; not supplying this parameter means it is false; should be false in production
    getApplication<Application>().applicationContext
)

val amountOfMoney = AmountOfMoney(
    1298L, // in cents as a Long
    "EUR" // three letter currency code as defined in ISO 4217
)

val paymentContext = PaymentContext(
    amountOfMoney,
    "NL", // two letter country code as defined in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
    false // true, if it is a recurring payment
)
```

> A successful response from Create Session can be used directly as input for the Session
> constructor.

- `clientSessionId` / `customerId` properties are used to authentication purposes. These can be obtained your server,
  using one of our available Server SDKs.
- The `clientApiUrl` and `assetBaseUrl` are the URLs the SDK should connect to. The SDK communicates with two types of
  servers to perform its tasks. One type of server offers the Client API as discussed above. And the other type of
  server stores the static resources used by the SDK, such as the logos of payment products.
- Payment information (`paymentContext`) is not needed to construct a session, but you will need to provide it when
  requesting any payment product information. The payment products that the customer can choose from depend on the
  provided payment information, so the Client SDK needs this information to be able to do its job. The payment
  information that is needed is:
    - the total amount of the payment, defined as property `amountOfMoney.amount`
    - the currency that should be used, defined as property `amountOfMoney.currencyCode`
    - the country of the person that is performing the payment, defined as property `countryCode`
    - whether the payment is a single payment or a recurring payment

### 2. Retrieve the payment items

Retrieve the payment products and accounts on file that can be used for this payment. Your application can use this data
to create the payment product selection screen.

**_java:_**

```java
// sync call
try {
    BasicPaymentItems basicPaymentItems = session.getBasicPaymentItemsSync(paymentContext);

    // Display the contents of basicPaymentItems & accountsOnFile to your customer.
} catch (e: ApiException) {
    // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
} catch (e: CommunicationException) {
    // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
try {
    val basicPaymentItems = session.getBasicPaymentItems(paymentContext)

    // Display the contents of basicPaymentItems & accountsOnFile to your customer.
} catch (e: ApiException) {
    // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
} catch (e: CommunicationException) {
    // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

For some payment products, customers can indicate that they want the Online Payments platform to store part of the data
they entered while using such a payment product. For example, it is possible to store the card holder name and the card
number for most credit card payment products. The stored data is referred to as an `AccountOnFile` or token.
`AccountOnFile` IDs available for the current payment must be provided in the request body of the Server API Create
Client Session call. When the customer wants to use the same payment product for another payment, it is possible to
select one of the stored accounts on file for this payment. In this case, the customer does not have to enter the
information that is already stored in the `AccountOnFile`. The list of available payment products that the SDK receives
from the Client API also contains the accounts on file for each payment product. Your application can present this list
of payment products and accounts on file to the customer.

If the customer wishes to use an existing `AccountOnFile` for a payment, the selected`AccountOnFile` should be added to
the `PaymentRequest`.

### 3. Retrieve payment product details

Retrieve all the details about the payment product - including it's fields - that the customer needs to provide based on
the selected payment product or account on file. Your app can use this information to create the payment product details
screen.

**_java:_**

```java
// sync call
try {
    PaymentProduct paymentProduct = session.getPaymentProductSync(paymentProductId, paymentContext);
    
    // Display the fields to your customer.
} catch (e: ApiException) {
    // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
} catch (e: CommunicationException) {
    // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
try {
   val paymentProduct = session.getPaymentProduct(paymentProductId, paymentContext)

   // Display the fields to your customer.
} catch (e: ApiException) {
   // Handle the exception thrown by the API. Usually, these are 4xx exceptions.
} catch (e: CommunicationException) {
   // Handle the communication exception - it can happen when the API call could not be established.
} catch (e: Exception) {
   // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

Once the customer has selected a payment product or stored account on file, the SDK can request which information needs
to be provided by the customer in order to perform a payment. When a single product is retrieved, the SDK provides a
list of all the fields that should be rendered, including display hints and validation rules. If the customer selected
an account on file, information that is already in this account on file can be prefilled in the input fields, instead of
requesting it from the customer. The data that can be stored and prefilled on behalf of the customer is of course in
line with applicable regulations. For instance, for a credit card transaction, the customer is still expected to input
the CVC. The details entered by the customer are stored in a `PaymentRequest`. Again, the example app can be used as the
starting point to create your screen. If there is no additional information that needs to be entered, this screen can be
skipped.

### 4. Encrypt payment information

Encrypt all the provided payment information in the `PaymentRequest` using `session.preparePaymentRequest`. This
function will return a `PreparedPaymentRequest` which contains the encrypted payment request fields and encoded client
meta info. The encrypted fields result is in a format that can be processed by the Server API. The only thing you need
to provide to the SDK are the values the customer provided in your screens. Once you have retrieved the encrypted fields
String from the `PreparedPaymentRequest`, your application should send it to your server, which in turn should forward
it to the Server API.

**_java:_**

```java
try {
    PreparedPaymentRequest preparedRequest = session.preparePaymentRequestSync(paymentRequest);

    // Send the preparedRequest.encryptedFields to your server and use it to create the payment with the Server SDK.
} catch (e: EncryptDataException) {
    // Handle the ecryption exception.
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

**_kotlin:_**

```kotlin
try {
    val preparedRequest = session.preparePaymentRequest(paymentRequest)

    // Send the preparedRequest.encryptedFields to your server and use it to create the payment with the Server SDK.
} catch (e: EncryptDataException) {
    // Handle the ecryption exception.
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle any other unhandled exception.
}
```

All the heavy lifting, such as requesting a public key from the Client API, performing the encryption and BASE-64
encoding the result into one string, is done for you by the SDK. You only need to make sure that the `PaymentRequest`
object contains all the information entered by the user.

From your server, make a create payment request, providing the encrypted data in the `encryptedCustomerInput` field.

### 5. Response from the Server API call

It is up to you and your application to show the customer the correct screens based on the response of the Server API
call. In some cases, the payment has not finished yet since the customer must be redirected to a third party (such as a
bank or PayPal) to authorise the payment. See the Server API documentation on what kinds of responses the Server API can
return. The Client API has no part in the remainder of the payment.
